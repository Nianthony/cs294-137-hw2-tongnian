# HW2: Building Unity Game in Simulated AR

In this homework I build a simple AR Game, Whack a Mole. Here are the reference, features of my game and google drive link for my unity package and introduction video  

## Reference

After I decided to make a whack a mole game. I first searched those free 3D model on internet. They don't have a good visual performance. And I found this template in the unity asset store. 

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/whack-a-mole-82155

I used the prefabs (moles, trees and stones), font, audio and part of the animation to set up my unity scene. I took part of the codes in the template as my reference or tutorial for coding my own part. I rewriting the judgement condition in the game mechanism for it works different in the ARsimulation environment becuase those Raycast funtion cannot be simply implement in the simulation environment.


## Link

I used the .gitignore file and tried to push my unity files to my repo. But I got lot of troubles in the process, like the name of my files are too long and there are lot of .meta fils doesn't include in the .gitignore template. I consdier it would be very inconvenient to view the incomplete unity engineering documents. So I export the unity package and put it in my google drive link. The video is also in my google drive.
